    "# HashiCorp Vault Demo for Key Management Secrets Engine \n",
    "\n",
    "The Key Management secrets engine provides a consistent workflow for distribution and lifecycle management of cryptographic keys in various key management service (KMS) providers. It allows organizations to maintain centralized control of their keys in Vault while still taking advantage of cryptographic capabilities native to the KMS providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The secrets engine generates and owns original copies of key material. When an operator decides to distribute and manage the lifecycle of a key in one of the supported KMS providers, a copy of the key material is distributed. This provides additional durability and disaster recovery means for the complete lifecycle of the key in the KMS provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supported KMS Providers include:\n",
    "- Azure Key Vault\n",
    "- AWS KMS\n",
    "- GCP Cloud KMS\n",
    "\n",
    "Ref: https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/key-management#kms-providers \n",
    "\n",
    "Supported Key Types include:\n",
    "- aes256-gcm96 - AES-GCM with a 256-bit AES key and a 96-bit nonce (symmetric)\n",
    "- rsa-2048 - RSA with bit size of 2048 (asymmetric)\n",
    "- rsa-3072 - RSA with bit size of 3072 (asymmetric)\n",
    "- rsa-4096 - RSA with bit size of 4096 (asymmetric)\n",
    "- ecdsa-p256 - ECDSA using the P-256 elliptic curve (asymmetric)\n",
    "- ecdsa-p384 - ECDSA using the P-384 elliptic curve (asymmetric)\n",
    "- ecdsa-p521 - ECDSA using the P-521 elliptic curve (asymmetric)\n",

    "\n",
    "This setup is tested on MacOS and is meant to simulate a distributed setup.  The components used in this demo are:\n",
    "- Vault Enterprise installed on docker (to simulate an external Vault)\n",
    "- You have the Vault CLI installed\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes your Vault server is installed using docker and already running on http://127.0.0.1:8200\n",
    "and you have set your `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN` variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You will need Vault to be installed with an ADP-KM license add-on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements to Run This Demo\n",
    "You will need Visual Studio Code to be installed with the Jupyter plugin.  To run this notebook in VS Code, chose the Jupyter kernel and then Bash.\n",
    "- To run the current cell, use Ctrl + Enter.\n",
    "- To run the current cell and advance to the next, use Shift+Enter.\n"
